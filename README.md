The system being developed here is a WebRTC client server system that allows requesting users in the physical world to provide services to users located elsewhere. uzers can interact via voice and video. Additionally users may "draw" on the video and message each other. There is a way to get "followers" and build "rooms".

The system is originally planned as a way for users in retail stores to send vodeos of products in store to uers online. Kind of bridging the physical-digital divide. Work is on going wrt the experience.

The system uses OpenTok for WebRTC and a backend of Python and Java/Spring. The front end is supprted on the Web and Android[via Cordova/Ionic]
